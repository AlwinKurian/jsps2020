            <p>
                I am Gurmanpreet Kaur Grewal and I hail from Punjab state of India. I have done M.tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Punjab Agricultural University. I am working as a senior research fellow at Punjab Agricultural University and there I got a chance to work on web application using MVC framework CodeIgniter. Developing web applications certainly intrigues me, the reason I chose this course and I want to be confident enough in coding part. In free time, I like reading novels of genre fiction with a cup of coffee since I am a caffeine person and I have finished The Zahir by Paulo Coelho lately. Moreover, I am a fitness freak and nowadays I am working on inversions and abs.<br> Thank You !
